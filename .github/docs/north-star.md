# Senior Schools Network — North Star

## Overview

This repository serves as the foundational hub for the Senior Schools Network project, inspired by the educational philosophy of Dr. John Senior as articulated in _The Restoration of Innocence: An Idea of a School_ ,the _Integrated Humanities lecture_ and related works. The project's north star is the promotion and loose affiliation of schools that embody education through sense, story & liturgy: poetic knowledge, natural exploration & sense based learning, liturgical rhythm, and narrative immersion, integrated with spiritual and moral formation rooted in Catholic and Western tradition. Drawing from Senior's emphasis on the "poetic mode" of apprehension—where knowledge begins with wonder, senses, and imagination, and rejects rigid schemas in favor of organic, experiential growth through good educators—this initiative focuses on identifying and highlighting existing schools that align with these principles, while encouraging new initiatives without imposition.

The objectives are:

1. **School Network Promotion**: Discover and promote schools already operating in this spirit (e.g., from an existing list of programs, high schools and colleges), fostering a loose network for mutual support and visibility.
2. **Encouragement for Participation**: Provide avenues for schools to apply for affiliation, individuals to reach out, or aspiring founders to start aligned schools  by connecting them with others alreaedy engaged in such work. Additial informal guidance is offered from the network—emphasizing flexibility and the role of dedicated educators over standardized curricula.
3. **Digital Platform**: Develop a website to showcase Senior's ideas, share resources (e.g., book lists, excerpts, media), and connect educators, parents, and stakeholders.

All development in this repository must align with these goals, ensuring outputs reflect Senior's vision of education as soul formation through repose, wonder, and integrated humanities, without enforcing schemas that contradict the poetic, connatural approach.

## Foundational Influence: The Integrated Humanities Program (IHP)

The Senior Schools Network traces its spiritual lineage to the Integrated Humanities Program (IHP), founded by Dr. John Senior along with Dennis Quinn and Frank Nelick at the University of Kansas from 1967 to 1983. As the "grandfather" of this project, the IHP exemplified poetic knowledge through immersive experiences in great books, poetry recitation, music, stargazing, and communal activities like waltzing—designed to awaken wonder and pursue truth without rigid structures. This program, which led to profound conversions and lifelong transformations among students, emphasized the poetic mode as the fertile soil for wisdom, countering modern fragmentation by integrating senses, emotions, and intellect in a Catholic-inspired framework. The network honors this legacy by promoting similar educator-driven, wonder-based approaches in contemporary schools, adapting IHP's principles of repose and narrative immersion for stages like the gymnasium (physical adventure) while maintaining organic flexibility.

## Core Philosophy

The guiding light is Senior's framework from the _Integrated Humanities lecture_ and _The Restoration of Innocence_, synthesized with complementary texts such as excerpts from Hugh of St. Victor's _Didascalicon_, G.K. Chesterton's _The Outline of Sanity_, Tolkien's _Mythopoeia_, Boethius's _The Consolation of Philosophy_, papal encyclicals like _Rerum Novarum_, and Aquinas's _Summa Theologica_ (e.g., on intellectual knowledge). This collection of works is to show that these are timeless educational ideas and wisdom and that this philosophy is inherently Catholic, exclusionary in its fidelity to core tenets, and resistant to modern systematization.

### Key Concepts

- **Poetic Knowledge**: As described in Taylor's excerpts (from _Poetic Knowledge: The Recovery of Education_), this is an intuitive, connatural mode of knowing through senses, emotions, and imagination—contrasting with rational or scientific modes. It begins with wonder (e.g., a child's encounter with nature) and progresses to wisdom. Senior's "five modes of knowledge" (gymnastic, musical, poetic, dialectic, rhetoric) and "eight modes of teaching" emphasize starting from sensory delight, as in Hugh of St. Victor's sensory ascent to wisdom, relying on good educators rather than imposed structures. From Tolkien's _Mythopoeia_: "Man, sub-creator, the refracted light through whom is splintered from a single White to many hues, and endlessly combined in living shapes that move from mind to mind."

- **Liturgical Rhythm and Spiritual Formation**: Education mirrors the "ages of man" (nursery, gymnasium, poetic, etc.), integrated with daily prayer, sacraments, and seasonal feasts in a flexible, organic way. Senior's "hortus conclusus" (enclosed garden) evokes a protected space for innocence, drawing from _Rerum Novarum_'s emphasis on justice, property, and family. Liturgical immersion and narrative adventures foster repose and virtue, countering modern mechanization (per Chesterton), without rigid curricula. From Boethius's _The Consolation of Philosophy_: "Earth we grasp with the earthly, fire with flame, Liquid with moisture, air with our breath."

- **Physical Discipline and Adventure**: Particularly in the gymnasium stage (ages 7-13), education incorporates bodily rigor and experiential challenges—harsh at times—to form resilient individuals, especially boys into "Chivalric Wayfarers." This blends sports, outdoor adventures, and risk-taking with stories, learning, and liturgical rhythms with stories, addressing contemporary issues like sedentary lifestyles and the erosion of physical resilience in modern youth. It counters cultural softness by emphasizing benevolent neglect and natural toughness with play and story. From Chesterton's _The Ballad of the White Horse_: "For the end of the world was long ago, And all we dwell to-day As children of some second birth, Like a strange people left on earth After a judgment day."

- **Poetic Foundations for Scientific Pursuit**: Poetic knowledge serves as the fertile soil for scientific inquiry, nurturing imagination and wonder as prerequisites for disciplined reasoning. Modern education often misorders this, prioritizing analysis over wonder—IHP countered this through stargazing and poetry as gateways to truth. From Aquinas's _Summa Theologica_ (Question 84, Article 1): "The soul knows bodies through the intellect."

## User-Centric Design (StoryBrand Framework)

The platform follows the StoryBrand methodology. Visitors (parents, educators, aspiring founders) are positioned as the "hero" seeking restoration of innocence in education, facing problems like cultural decay and loss of wonder. Senior's philosophy and the network serve as the empathetic "guide," providing a clear plan for exploration, affiliation, and inspiration.

### Primary User Flow (Discovery → School Consideration)

As a parent (hero), I seek an education rooted in wonder, faith, and formation for my children—whether in the nursery years, gymnasium stage, or beyond (problem: modern schooling fragments learning and neglects the soul). I discover Senior's ideas as a guide, explore schools and programs aligned with my child's current stage, and achieve success (children formed through sense, story, and liturgy at each phase of growth).

_Flow_: Home → Philosophy Overview → Schools Directory (filter by stage) → CTA: "Inquire About Enrollment" or "Apply to Affiliate."

_Waypoint_: "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord." (Ephesians 6:4)

### Secondary User Flow (Resource Exploration → Family Application)

As a homeschooling parent or engaged family (hero), I want to enrich my children's formation at their current stage—whether nursery wonder, gymnasium adventure, or poetic reflection (problem: lack of resources grounded in this tradition). Senior's resources guide me to adapt ideas at home—nature walks for the young, physical challenges and crafts for the middle years, great books for the older—succeeding in cultivating fertile soil for my children's souls.

_Flow_: Home/Resources → Browse by stage or theme → CTA: "Download Family Guide" or "Explore Book Lists."

_Waypoint_: "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." (Proverbs 22:6)

### Tertiary User Flow (Inspiration → Founding or Teaching)

As an aspiring founder or educator (hero), I recognize a gap in faithful, wonder-based education—perhaps at a specific stage underserved in my region (problem: isolation and lack of models). Senior's resources connect me with others already doing this work, providing inspiration and informal guidance to found or join a stage-specific initiative.

_Flow_: Home → Encouragement page → CTA: "Reach Out for Guidance" or "Connect with Founders."

_Waypoint_: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28)

## Guardrails and Principles

- **Alignment**: All contributions must reference uploaded documents for authenticity; promote balanced, non-partisan viewpoints. Avoid imposing curricula—focus on promotion and loose connections.
- **Ethical Focus**: Emphasize charity, humility; avoid moralizing—treat users as adults pursuing truth.
- **Derivation Chain**: Technical details derive from `technical.md`; AI instructions from `copilot-instructions.md`; backlog from `next-steps.md`.
- **Iteration**: Use phases for builds; commit changes with references to philosophy.

This north star ensures the project remains faithful to Senior's vision, fostering a renaissance in education through poetic, faith-integrated means without rigid enforcement.
