# Phase 1: Planning & Content Gathering

## Overview
This phase focuses on synthesizing the uploaded content from documents such as *The Restoration of Innocence* by John Senior, the "Thousand Good Books" list, excerpts from Hugh of St. Victor, G.K. Chesterton's *The Outline of Sanity*, Tolkien's *Mythopoeia*, Boethius's *The Consolation of Philosophy*, the encyclical *Rerum Novarum*, and Aquinas's *Summa Theologica* (QQ. 84-88). We will outline the site structure, define user flows inspired by the StoryBrand methodology, and integrate guiding quotes from the content and Scripture to move users through the experience. All elements are grounded in Senior's philosophy of poetic knowledge—intuitive, sensory-based apprehension rooted in wonder—and Catholic tradition, emphasizing organic discovery over imposed schemas.

The goal is to create a site blueprint that positions visitors (parents, educators, aspiring school founders) as the "heroes" seeking restoration of innocence in education, with Senior's ideas as the wise "guide." User flows will incorporate quotes to evoke wonder, narrative immersion, and spiritual reflection, drawing directly from the documents. Scripture (from the Douay-Rheims Bible, as recommended in Senior's list) will anchor the flows in eternal truths.

Expected Outcomes:
- A detailed site blueprint (structure and flows) documented here.
- Synthesized content files (e.g., JSON or Markdown for excerpts, book lists in tables).
- Wireframe sketches or descriptions for visual layout.
- Assets list (e.g., images from book covers in PDFs).
- Updated repository ready for Phase 2 prompts.

## Content Synthesis
We begin by reviewing and organizing uploaded content to ensure authenticity:
- **Key Themes Extracted**:
  - Poetic Knowledge: "Poetic knowledge is the attempt to know the way a child knows things, or the way a lover knows the beloved. It gets inside and becomes a part of what is known." (from excerpts.md, Taylor's synthesis of Senior).
  - Wonder and Restoration: "Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. Aristotle stated that 'all men by nature desire to know,' but this desire is first sparked by wonder." (from excerpts.md).
  - Stages of Development: Categorized book lists from "John Senior The Thousand Good Books List.txt" (e.g., Nursery: Mother Goose; Gymnasium: Robin Hood).
  - Spiritual Grounding: "The Bible. For cultural purposes, there are only two English Bibles: for the Protestants the King James Version and for Catholics the Douay-Rheims." (from Senior's list).
  - Cultural Critique: "Now we wish it to be understood that our policy is to give him power by giving him these things." (from Chesterton's *The Outline of Sanity*, emphasizing property and independence).
  - Faith and Justice: "Every man has by nature the right to possess property as his own." (from *Rerum Novarum*).
  - Intellectual Soul: "The human soul understands itself through its own act of understanding." (from Aquinas's *Summa Theologica*, Q. 88).
  - Sub-Creation: "The heart of man is not compound of lies, but draws some wisdom from the only Wise." (from Tolkien's *Mythopoeia*).
  - Consolation: "The highest curative in life is the pursuit of Wisdom." (adapted from Boethius's *The Consolation of Philosophy*).

- **Organized Outputs**:
  - Book Lists: Tables by life stages (e.g., Nursery, Gymnasium) for easy integration.
  - Excerpts: Markdown files with 5-10 key passages per document, tagged for themes (e.g., wonder, liturgical rhythm).
  - Scripture Ties: Selected verses like Ephesians 5:15-16 ("See, brethren, how you walk circumspectly... redeeming the time, because the days are evil") to frame restoration.
  - Assets: Extract book covers/images from PDFs; list media links from resources.md (e.g., videos, podcasts).

This synthesis ensures the site is deeply rooted in the content, promoting schools organically through inspirational narratives.

## Site Structure Outline
The site adopts a simple, hierarchical structure evoking classical order and natural flow, like Senior's "hortus conclusus" (enclosed garden). It uses a clean, mobile-responsive design with narrative elements (e.g., scrolling sections guided by quotes). No complex features—focus on discovery and connection.

- **Home Page**: Introduction to Senior's philosophy and the network. Hero section with a wonder-evoking quote: "Wonder is the beginning of wisdom" (excerpts.md). Overview of poetic knowledge, call to explore schools/resources.
- **About John Senior**: Biography drawn from prefaces and excerpts, grounded in his vision: "Education is not merely about filling a child’s mind with knowledge; it is about forming their soul" (excerpts.md).
- **Philosophy & Resources**: Core ideas (poetic knowledge, stages of development) with tables of book lists. Sub-sections for excerpts, media (embeds from resources.md), and Scripture ties (e.g., Proverbs 1:7: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom").
- **Schools Network**: Directory of existing schools (from your list, primarily high schools/colleges), with profiles highlighting organic alignments. Map or list view.
- **Join the Network**: Application form for affiliation; encouragement for starting schools with informal guidance (e.g., "Find good educators and begin with wonder," per Senior).
- **Blog/Insights**: Articles analyzing content (e.g., Tolkien's sub-creation in education), grounded in documents.
- **Contact**: Inquiry form for outreach, tied to Scripture like Matthew 7:7 ("Ask, and it shall be given you").

Footer: Network ethos quote: "We make still by the law in which we were made" (from *Mythopoeia*).

## User Flows with StoryBrand Integration
User flows are designed using StoryBrand's 7-part framework, positioning the visitor as the "hero" (seeking authentic education), the network/Senior's ideas as the "guide," and restoration of innocence as the "success." Flows guide users through narrative paths, interspersed with quotes from content and Scripture to evoke wonder and spiritual depth. Flows are simple, intuitive, and mobile-friendly.

### Primary Flow: Discovery to Affiliation (Parent/Educator as Hero)
1. **A Character (Hero Enters)**: User lands on Home. Problem introduced: Modern education's fragmentation ("The mind, stupefied by bodily sensations... has forgotten what it was," from Hugh of St. Victor in excerpts.md).
2. **Has a Problem**: Highlight external (cultural decay), internal (loss of wonder), philosophical (schema failures) issues. Quote: "Without love, education is nothing" (excerpts.md).
3. **Meets a Guide**: Introduce Senior/network as empathetic authority. Scripture: "Come to me, all you that labour... and I will refresh you" (Matthew 11:28, Douay-Rheims).
4. **Who Gives Them a Plan**: Step-by-step: Explore resources → View schools → Apply/Start. Quote: "Connection and wonder are the driving forces. Love is the anchor" (excerpts.md).
5. **Calls Them to Action**: Prominent CTAs: "Explore Schools," "Apply to Join," "Start Your School."
6. **That Helps Avoid Failure**: Warn of continued decay without action. Quote: "The days are evil" (Ephesians 5:16).
7. **And Ends in Success**: Vision of restored innocence. Quote: "Blessed are the legend-makers with their rhyme of things not found within recorded time" (from *Mythopoeia*).

**Flow Diagram (Text-Based Wireframe)**:
- Home → Click "Learn More" (guided by wonder quote) → Philosophy Page → Interact with book table → CTA: "Find a School" → Network Directory → Profile view → "Apply to Join" form.
- Alternative: Home → "Start a School" section → Encouragement quote ("The highest curative in life is the pursuit of Wisdom," from Boethius) → Contact form.

### Secondary Flow: Resource Exploration (Aspiring Founder as Hero)
1. **Character/Problem**: Seeks inspiration amid educational woes.
2. **Guide/Plan**: Navigate to Resources; plan: Read excerpts → Download lists → Reach out.
3. **Action/Success**: CTA to contact; success: "Form saints-in-the-making" (excerpts.md). Scripture: "Train up a child in the way he should go" (Proverbs 22:6).

**Flow Diagram**:
- Home → "Resources" (quote: "Poetic knowledge synthesizes, brings together, integrates") → Browse excerpts → Download PDF → "Inspired? Contact Us."

All flows emphasize organic progression, with quotes/Scripture as "waypoints" (e.g., overlay modals or section headers) to immerse users in content.

## Assets Gathering
- **Images**: Book covers from PDFs; symbolic icons (e.g., garden for hortus conclusus).
- **Media**: Embed links from resources.md; prepare thumbnails.
- **Additional**: Simple wireframes (export to repo); ensure all grounded in documents.

## Next Steps
- Derive prompts for Phase 2 (e.g., generate homepage component).
- Commit synthesized content to repo.
- Review for alignment: Does it promote without prescribing? (Yes, per north star.)

This blueprint sets a poetic, faith-grounded foundation for the site.
