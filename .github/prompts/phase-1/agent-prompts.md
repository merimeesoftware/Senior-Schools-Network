# Phase 1 Agent Prompts

Use these prompts to generate Phase 1 outputs. Always read README.md, .github/technical.md, .github/roadmap.md, and .github/current-phase.md first. Respect .github/instructions.md.

## Prompt: Generate Site Blueprint
Goal: Update docs/site-blueprint.md with IA, flows, quotes, and wireframes.
Constraints: No code scaffolding. Reference sources for quotes.

## Prompt: Synthesize Excerpts and Tables
Goal: Update content/phase-1-excerpts.md and ensure book lists are organized for stages.
Constraints: Use only existing repo texts; attribute sources.

## Prompt: Create Assets Inventory
Goal: Update docs/assets-inventory.md with planned images/media and sources.
Constraints: Only list; do not add binaries in Phase 1.

## Prompt: Alignment Validation
