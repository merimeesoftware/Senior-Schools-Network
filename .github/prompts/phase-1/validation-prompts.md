# Phase 1 Validation Prompts

Use these to confirm outputs align with the north star and technical plan.

## Validation: Alignment to North Star
- Does the blueprint and content promote discovery and affiliation, not prescriptive curricula?
- Are quotes/scripture used minimally, attributed, and grounded in repo sources?
- Is Catholic fidelity preserved in tone and selections?

## Validation: Technical Constraints
- Are outputs Markdown-only and placed in docs/ or content/ appropriately?
- No premature implementation (Next.js/Tailwind) or forms/analytics added?

## Validation: Roadmap Consistency
- Do deliverables match Phase 1 in .github/roadmap.md (blueprint, content, wireframes, assets, baseline CI note)?

## Validation: Definition of Done
- docs/site-blueprint.md present and complete?
- docs/assets-inventory.md drafted?
- content files synthesized or referenced?
- prompts/phase-1 prepared?
