# Asset Inventory

Use this checklist to source, commission, and track imagery, illustration, and media assets required to fully realize the Senior Schools Network experience.

## Tracking & Governance

- Maintain a shared catalog (spreadsheet or CMS) mapping each asset to page/section, owner, source URL, licensing terms, and renewal or attribution requirements.
- Record alt text and caption guidance when the asset is logged. Derive descriptions from surrounding copy (e.g., "Illustration of poetic knowledge from Hugh of St. Victor").
- Store master files alongside optimized web exports (webp/jpg/png) in an organized structure under `content/assets/` with thumbnails for previews.
- Note any placeholders currently in use so they can be swapped once custom photography or illustration lands.

## Images

- Apply consistent color grading (forest greens, gymnasium reds, parchment neutrals) to unify disparate sources.
- Revisit asset inventory each release cycle to avoid regressions to low-res or placeholder imagery.
- Version assets with semantic naming (e.g., `home-hero-2025-raphael.jpg`) to avoid cache issues and ease updates.
