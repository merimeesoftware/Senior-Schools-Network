# Site Blueprint (Phase 1)

Derived from README.md (north star), .github/current-phase.md, .github/technical.md, and .github/roadmap.md.

## Purpose

Promote a loose network of Catholic schools aligned with John Senior's philosophy. Inspire discovery and affiliation across three user paths: (1) school consideration/enrollment, (2) personal/family application (homeschool adaptations), (3) founding inspiration for new initiatives (especially gymnasium stage). Emphasize gymnasium restoration (physical discipline, adventure for ages 7-13) and poetic foundations for scientific pursuit. Avoid prescriptive curricula; provide non-prescriptive guides and resources. Honor the Integrated Humanities Program (IHP) as the project's grandfather—Senior's wonder-awakening initiative at the University of Kansas, integrating poetry, music, and experiential learning as a model for poetic knowledge.

## Enhanced User Flows (StoryBrand Three-Path System)

### Primary User Flow: School Consideration/Affiliation (Parent of Boys as Hero)

**Target**: Parents seeking gymnasium-stage education for sons (ages 7-13) or high school with formation emphasis.

1. **Hero enters with problem**: Gymnasium gap in modern education—lacking adventure and formation amid cultural softness.
2. **Meets Guide**: Senior's ideas/network as empathetic authority. Quote from _The Restoration of Innocence_: "Adventure, stories, physical discipline."
3. **Plan**: Explore resources → View schools (directory with boarding/gymnasium filters) → Inquire about enrollment/Apply to affiliate.
4. **Action**: CTAs — "Inquire About Enrollment," "Apply to Affiliate."
5. **Avoids Failure**: Warns of continued mechanized schooling without resilience formation.
6. **Success**: Resilient, faith-formed sons as "warrior poets." Waypoint: "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord." (Ephesians 6:4).

**Flow Diagram**: Home (hero quote from _Mythopoeia_: "We make still by the law in which we're made.") → Philosophy (gymnasium emphasis) → Schools Directory (filter by high school boarding) → CTA: "Inquire" or "Apply."

### Secondary User Flow: Personal/Family Application (Homeschooling Parent as Hero)

**Target**: Homeschoolers excelling in nursery but seeking gymnasium inspiration.

1. **Hero/Problem**: Homeschooler seeks gymnasium inspiration amid lacking institutional options.
2. **Guide/Plan**: Senior's resources guide home adaptation. Browse excerpts/book lists (Robin Hood, adventure focus) → Download gymnasium guide.
3. **Action**: CTA — "Download Gymnasium Guide" (non-prescriptive PDF with family adventure ideas).
4. **Success**: Family formation through home adventures; unpoisoning soil for holistic growth. Waypoint: "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." (Proverbs 22:6).

**Flow Diagram**: Home/Resources (quote from _The Restoration of Innocence_: "Homeschooling shines in nursery—gymnasium awaits your courage") → Browse excerpts (physical discipline themes) → Book lists (adventure) → CTA: "Download Guide."

### Tertiary User Flow: Founding Inspiration (Aspiring Founder as Hero)

**Target**: Visionaries recognizing gymnasium gap, inspired to found stage-specific schools.

1. **Hero/Problem**: Founder recognizes gymnasium gap—sorely lacking amid strong nursery homeschooling and high schools.
2. **Guide/Plan**: Senior's vision as inspiration. Explore encouragement page → Connect via network → Access founding toolkit.
3. **Action**: CTAs — "Reach Out for Guidance," "Founder's Toolkit" (informal checklist, not rigid curriculum).
4. **Success**: Stage-specific school founded (e.g., gymnasium for boys). Waypoint: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28).

**Flow Diagram**: Home (quote from _The Consolation of Philosophy_: "Earth we grasp with the earthly, fire with flame, Liquid with moisture, air with our breath.") → Encouragement (IHP-inspired) → CTA: "Reach Out" or "Toolkit."

## Cross-Flow Stories

- **As any user** (parent, homeschooler, founder), I want to explore curated book lists by stage (Nursery, Gymnasium with adventure emphasis, Poetic with scientific soil, Spiritual) so I can nurture holistic formation grounded in wonder and Catholic tradition.
- **As any user**, I want to browse excerpts from Senior, Tolkien, and Aquinas (including gymnasium themes like benevolent neglect) so I can integrate poetic knowledge into my context (school, home, or founding).

## Marketing & Narrative Immersion Strategy

The site functions as a storytelling tool, using full quotes and Scripture as "waypoints" to guide users through narrative paths. This approach promotes the network organically by evoking wonder and spiritual reflection across three user flows (school consideration, personal/family application, founding inspiration), rather than through prescriptive mandates. Enhanced emphasis on gymnasium restoration (physical discipline, adventure for "warrior poets") and poetic foundations for scientific pursuit addresses contemporary gaps while maintaining non-prescriptive ethos. Reference IHP as a historical model for wonder-based immersion.

### Key Strategies:

- **Quotes as Anchors**: Hero sections, page headers, and modals feature full quotes from sources (e.g., _Mythopoeia_: "The heart of man is not compound of lies, but draws some wisdom from the only Wise, and still recalls him."; Hugh of St. Victor on sensory ascent; _The Restoration of Innocence_ on "adventure, stories, physical discipline") to immerse users in poetic knowledge before they encounter practical information. Gymnasium-specific quotes evoke bodily rigor and resilience.
- **Scripture Ties**: Full verses like "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." (Proverbs 22:6) frame the network as a faith-grounded guide, positioning school affiliation, home application, and founding as spiritual acts. "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord." (Ephesians 6:4) specifically anchors gymnasium/discipline themes.
- **Narrative Progression**: User flows mirror StoryBrand's 7-part framework across three paths, with each page advancing the "hero's journey" from problem (gymnasium gap, cultural softness, fragmentation) to success (resilient "warrior poets," unpoisoned developmental soil, stage-specific schools founded). CTAs like "Inquire About Enrollment," "Download Gymnasium Guide," and "Founder's Toolkit" serve as plot points.
- **Sensory Language**: Descriptions emphasize experiential elements (e.g., "enclosed garden," "liturgical hikes," "outdoor challenges," "benevolent neglect") to align with poetic, connatural knowing and gymnasium adventure. Evokes physical resilience alongside spiritual formation.
- **Non-Prescriptive Tone**: Resources are presented as "inspiration" rather than "requirements," maintaining the organic, educator-driven ethos. Gymnasium Guide and Founder's Toolkit are explicitly non-prescriptive (informal, adaptable).
- **Three-Path System**: Marketing clarity enhanced by distinct flows for parents seeking schools, homeschoolers adapting at home, and founders launching initiatives. Each path uses tailored waypoints (e.g., "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord." Ephesians 6:4 for school parents, "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." Proverbs 22:6 for homeschoolers, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Matthew 11:28 for founders).

This strategy ensures the site itself embodies Senior's philosophy, making promotion a byproduct of authentic, wonder-filled content that addresses contemporary educational gaps (gymnasium, misordered STEM) while inspiring diverse paths (school, home, founding) for restoration.
