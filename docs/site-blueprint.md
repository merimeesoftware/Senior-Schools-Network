# Site Blueprint (Phase 1)

Derived from README.md (north star), .github/current-phase.md, .github/technical.md, and .github/roadmap.md.

## Purpose

Promote a loose network of Catholic schools aligned with John Senior's philosophy. Inspire discovery and affiliation across three user paths: (1) school consideration/enrollment, (2) personal/family application (homeschool adaptations), (3) founding inspiration for new initiatives (especially gymnasium stage). Emphasize gymnasium restoration (physical discipline, adventure for ages 7-13) and poetic foundations for scientific pursuit. Avoid prescriptive curricula; provide non-prescriptive guides and resources.

## User Stories (Aligned with Three Flows)

### Primary Flow Stories (School Consideration/Affiliation)

- **As a parent of boys**, I recognize the gymnasium gap in modern education—lacking adventure and formation amid cultural softness—and seek a school that forms "warrior poets" through physical discipline, stories, and faith.
- **As an educator**, I want to explore high schools with gymnasium/boarding emphasis aligned with Senior's ideas so I can discern if my institution should affiliate or if I should transition to a network school.
- **As a parent**, I want to inquire about enrollment in affiliated schools so my sons experience resilient, faith-formed education as described in _The Restoration of Innocence_.

### Secondary Flow Stories (Personal/Family Application - Homeschool)

- **As any user**, I want to browse excerpts from Senior, Tolkien, and Aquinas (including gymnasium themes like benevolent neglect) so I can integrate poetic knowledge into my context (school, home, or founding).

## Marketing & Narrative Immersion Strategy

The site functions as a storytelling tool, using quotes and Scripture as "waypoints" to guide users through narrative paths. This approach promotes the network organically by evoking wonder and spiritual reflection across three user flows (school consideration, personal/family application, founding inspiration), rather than through prescriptive mandates. Enhanced emphasis on gymnasium restoration (physical discipline, adventure for "warrior poets") and poetic foundations for scientific pursuit addresses contemporary gaps while maintaining non-prescriptive ethos.

### Key Strategies:

- **Quotes as Anchors**: Hero sections, page headers, and modals feature quotes from sources (e.g., _Mythopoeia_: "We make still by the law in which we're made"; Hugh of St. Victor on sensory ascent; _The Restoration of Innocence_ on "adventure, stories, physical discipline") to immerse users in poetic knowledge before they encounter practical information. Gymnasium-specific quotes evoke bodily rigor and resilience.
- **Scripture Ties**: Verses like Proverbs 22:6 ("Train up a child..."), Matthew 11:28 ("Come to me... and I will refresh you"), and Ephesians 6:4 ("Bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord") frame the network as a faith-grounded guide, positioning school affiliation, home application, and founding as spiritual acts. Ephesians 6:4 specifically anchors gymnasium/discipline themes.
- **Narrative Progression**: User flows mirror StoryBrand's 7-part framework across three paths, with each page advancing the "hero's journey" from problem (gymnasium gap, cultural softness, fragmentation) to success (resilient "warrior poets," unpoisoned developmental soil, stage-specific schools founded). CTAs like "Inquire About Enrollment," "Download Gymnasium Guide," and "Founder's Toolkit" serve as plot points.
- **Sensory Language**: Descriptions emphasize experiential elements (e.g., "enclosed garden," "liturgical hikes," "outdoor challenges," "benevolent neglect") to align with poetic, connatural knowing and gymnasium adventure. Evokes physical resilience alongside spiritual formation.
- **Non-Prescriptive Tone**: Resources are presented as "inspiration" rather than "requirements," maintaining the organic, educator-driven ethos. Gymnasium Guide and Founder's Toolkit are explicitly non-prescriptive (informal, adaptable).
- **Three-Path System**: Marketing clarity enhanced by distinct flows for parents seeking schools, homeschoolers adapting at home, and founders launching initiatives. Each path uses tailored waypoints (e.g., Ephesians 6:4 for school parents, Proverbs 22:6 for homeschoolers, Matthew 11:28 for founders).

This strategy ensures the site itself embodies Senior's philosophy, making promotion a byproduct of authentic, wonder-filled content that addresses contemporary educational gaps (gymnasium, misordered STEM) while inspiring diverse paths (school, home, founding) for restoration.
