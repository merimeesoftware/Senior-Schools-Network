# Site Blueprint (Phase 1)

Derived from README.md (north star), .github/current-phase.md, .github/technical.md, and .github/roadmap.md.

## Purpose
Promote a loose network of Catholic schools aligned with John Senior’s philosophy. Inspire discovery and affiliation; avoid prescriptive curricula.

## Information Architecture
- Home
- About John Senior
- Philosophy & Resources
  - Poetic Knowledge
  - Stages of Development (Book Lists)
  - Excerpts (Markdown-driven)
  - Scripture Ties
  - Media Embeds
- Schools Network (Directory)
- Join the Network (Application/Encouragement)
- Blog/Insights
- Contact

## Primary User Flow (StoryBrand)
1. Hero enters with problem (fragmentation) → guided by Senior’s ideas
2. Plan: Explore resources → View schools → Apply/Start
3. Action: CTAs — Explore Schools, Apply, Start
4. Success: Restoration of innocence (quotes/scripture anchors)

## Quotes/Scripture Waypoints (Sources)
- Mythopoeia ("We make still by the law...")
- Proverbs 22:6; Matthew 11:28; Ephesians 5:15-16
- Hugh of St. Victor and Taylor/Senior on poetic knowledge

## Text Wireframes (Low-Fi)
- Home: Hero quote, brief explainer, three CTAs, featured schools/resources
- Philosophy: Tabs/sections for concepts, table for book lists
- Schools: Filterable list (static for now)
- Join: Encouragement text, outline of application fields (no form in Phase 1)
- Contact: Placeholder copy and guidance (no live form)

## Accessibility Notes
- Semantic headings, descriptive link text, ARIA for collapsible sections (Phase 2)

## Content Sources
- content/phase-1-excerpts.md
- content/texts/* (Mythopoeia, Summa, Thousand Good Books List, etc.)

## Out-of-Scope (Phase 1)
- Next.js/Tailwind implementation
- Interactive forms or analytics
