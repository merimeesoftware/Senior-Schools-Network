## I. SENSE AND STORY (Poetic Knowledge as Foundation)

**Philosophical Grounding:**  
Sensory delight forms the foundation of wonder and knowledge. Through the five senses—earth grasped with earthly touch, fire with flame—we encounter reality immediately. Poetic knowledge integrates sensation with imagination, joining sensory experience with narrative to awaken the whole person. This is not analysis but connaturality: knowing things from the inside, the way a lover knows the beloved.

### Quote Bank: Sense and Story

- "Poetic knowledge is the key to motivation because it is about what is REAL... Connection and wonder are the driving forces. Love is the anchor." — John Senior, _The Restoration of Innocence_ (Core definition of poetic knowledge)

- "Poetic knowledge is the attempt to know the way a child knows things, or the way a lover knows the beloved. It gets inside and becomes a part of what is known." — John Senior (Intimate knowing through union)

- "Earth we grasp with the earthly, fire with flame, Liquid with moisture, air with our breath." — Hugh of St. Victor, _Didascalicon_ I.1 (Sensory connaturality)

- "Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. Aristotle stated that 'all men by nature desire to know,' but this desire is first sparked by wonder." — James S. Taylor, _Poetic Knowledge_ (Wonder as gateway)

- "Listening is above all the gateway, along with looking, to the poetic mode." — James S. Taylor (Sensory receptivity)

- "A sensory-emotional experience of reality... [it] sees in delight, or even in terror, the significance of what is really there." — James S. Taylor (Integrated sensing)

- "To be connatural with a thing is to participate in some way with its nature... a metaphysical encounter." — James S. Taylor (Presence through participation)

- "Poetic knowledge is a knowledge through affective union. It proceeds from the essential recesses of the subjectivity enriched by the intuitive donations of the senses and of tendency or instinct." — Jacques Maritain, _Creative Intuition in Art and Poetry_ (Affective and sensory grounding)

- "The soul knows bodies through the intellect." — Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologica_ I, Q84, A1 (Intellectual mediation of sensory knowledge)

- "Our intellect derives intellectual knowledge from sensible things... The senses are necessary to the intellect, because they supply it with phantasms." — Thomas Aquinas, _Summa_ I, Q85, A1 (Senses as servants to intellect)

- "I look up at those heavens of thine, the work of thy hands, at the moon and the stars, which thou hast set in their places." — Psalm 8 (Knox) (Sensory wonder at creation)

- "Great is this force of memory, exceeding great, O my God... And men go abroad to admire the heights of mountains, the mighty billows of the sea... and pass themselves by." — Augustine, _Confessions_ X.8 (Sensory wonder and inward memory)

- "Man, sub-creator, the refracted light  
through whom is splintered from a single White  
to many hues, and endlessly combined  
in living shapes that move from mind to mind." — J.R.R. Tolkien, _Mythopoeia_

- "We make still by the law in which we're made." — J.R.R. Tolkien, _Mythopoeia_

- "Trees are not 'trees', until so named and seen  
and never were so named, till those had been  
who speech's involuted breath unfurled,  
faint echo and dim picture of the world." — J.R.R. Tolkien, _Mythopoeia_

## II. POETIC KNOWLEDGE (Intuitive Knowing Beyond Analysis)

**Philosophical Grounding:**  
Poetic knowledge synthesizes and integrates rather than fragments and analyzes. It looks to the whole, the essence, the nature—not piece by piece, but all at once. It is an intuitive, mysterious way of knowing reality that cannot always account for itself, yet it precedes and sustains all higher degrees of certainty. Wonder must come before reason; stargazing before equations.

### Quote Bank: Poetic Knowledge

- "Poetic knowledge synthesizes, brings together, integrates. It looks at the whole, the essence, the nature." — John Senior, _The Restoration of Innocence_ (Synthetic knowing)

- "Poetic knowledge is not the knowledge of poetry, nor is it even knowledge in the sense that we often think of today, that is, the mastery of scientific, technological, or business information. Rather, it is an intuitive, obscure, mysterious way of knowing reality, not always able to account for itself, but absolutely essential if one is ever to advance properly to the higher degrees of certainty." — James S. Taylor, _Poetic Knowledge_ (Mystery before mastery)

- "A spontaneous act of the external and internal senses with the intellect, integrated and whole, rather than an act associated with the powers of analytic reasoning." — James S. Taylor (Integrated faculties, not fragmented analysis)

- "Knowledge from the inside out, radically different in this regard from a knowledge about things." — James S. Taylor (Participatory knowing)

- "Poetic knowledge is knowledge which is non-conceptual, non-rational, and experiential. It is born in the preconscious of the spirit, through a natural inclination or connaturality of the intellect toward the world of things." — Jacques Maritain, _Creative Intuition in Art and Poetry_ (Preconscious and connate)

- "Poetic intuition is the capturing of one's own subjectivity in a glance which descends into the unconscious and the preconscious, and emerges into consciousness by grasping things in a unifying intuition together with the self." — Jacques Maritain (Unified self-knowledge through things)

- "Unlike conceptual knowledge, which abstracts and universalizes, poetic knowledge is individualizing and concrete, born from emotional connaturality rather than logical discourse. It is knowledge by inclination, where the soul knows through love and union." — Jacques Maritain (Concrete and personal, not universal and abstract)

- "It is your teenager understanding intuitively about a lever because he played on a see-saw for hours... or knowing the nature and the essence of a horse because you spend countless hours with them, not memorizing its anatomy. Poetic knowledge is learning a language by speaking it, not by picking apart every word." — James S. Taylor (Embodied and practical knowing)

- "Stargazing and poetry **before** astronomy equations. Wonder → imagination → disciplined inquiry (not reversed)." — IHP Model, (Right ordering of knowledge)

- "Modern education often misorders this, prioritizing analysis over wonder—IHP countered this through stargazing and poetry as gateways to truth." — (Critique of reversal)

- "Poetic knowledge serves as the fertile soil for scientific inquiry, nurturing imagination and wonder as prerequisites for disciplined reasoning." — (Poetic knowledge as foundation)

- "Of all things to be sought, the first is that Wisdom in which the Form of the Perfect Good stands fixed. Wisdom illuminates man so that he may recognize himself." — Hugh of St. Victor, _Didascalicon_ I.1 (Wisdom as self-recognition)

- "The first step in the training of guardians is the telling of tales... For the young cannot distinguish what is allegorical from what is not, and the beliefs which they acquire at that age are hard to erase." — Plato, _Republic_ II.376-377 (Stories as formative over analysis)

- "The instinct of imitation is implanted in man from childhood... and no less universal is the pleasure felt in things imitated." — Aristotle, _Poetics_ Ch. IV (Imitation as natural delight)

- "Poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular. By the universal, I mean how a person of a certain type will on occasion speak or act, according to the law of probability or necessity." — Aristotle, _Poetics_ Ch. IX (Poetry grasps essences)

- "Education is not merely about filling a child's mind with knowledge; it is about forming their soul. An education in wonder invites children... into a way of living that is slower, richer, and more contemplative." — James S. Taylor, synthesis (Soul formation through wonder)

- "Without love, education is nothing." — John Senior, _Restoration of Innocence_ II.3 (Love as prerequisite)

- "Love is patient, love is kind … it bears all things … hopes all things, endures all things." — St. Paul, 1 Cor. 13:4,7 (quoted by St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_) (Foundation of preventive education)

- "The educator at work among his pupils should make himself loved, if he wishes to be respected." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Love precedes respect)

- "The educator can still speak to him in the language of the heart, whether during the time of his education or later." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Heart language as pedagogy)

## III. MISSION AND ADVENTURE (The Gymnasium and Chivalric Formation)

**Philosophical Grounding:**  
Ages 7-13—the gymnasium—call forth boys' innate restlessness and power. Here, stripped of comfortable softness, they sharpen their senses through adventure, physical rigor, and narratives of courage. The Chivalric Wayfarer is formed not in classrooms but in forests, on quests, through stories of wandering heroes. Mission and adventure restore innocence amid cultural rubble.

### Quote Bank: Mission and Adventure

- "Boys burn with gem-like flames" — John Senior (Inherent power of boyhood)

- "_Puer_, the Latin word for 'boy,' derives from 'pure' because concupiscence has not reared up as yet. 'Pure' comes from _pyros_, purifying 'fire' (boys burn with gem-like flames) which in turn derives from _pu_, an Indo-European root meaning 'power,' or potential force like the energy in atoms and the elements." — John Senior, _Restoration of Innocence_ (Etymological essence of boyhood)

- "For the end of the world was long ago,  
And all we dwell to-day  
As children of some second birth,  
Like a strange people left on earth  
After a judgment day." — G.K. Chesterton, _The Ballad of the White Horse_

- "Blessed are the legend-makers with their rhyme  
of things not found within recorded time.  
It is not they that have forgot the Night,  
or bid us flee to organized delight." — J.R.R. Tolkien, _Mythopoeia_ (Myth-making against mechanization)

- "Blessed are the men of Noah's race that build  
their little arks, though frail and poorly filled,  
and steer through winds contrary towards a wraith,  
a rumour of a harbour guessed by faith." — J.R.R. Tolkien, _Mythopoeia_ (Faithful wayfaring through chaos)

- "And I thought, 'I will go with you,  
As man with God has gone,  
And wander with a wandering star,  
The wandering heart of things that are,  
The fiery cross of love and war  
That like yourself, goes on.'" — G.K. Chesterton, _The Ballad of the White Horse_

- "In some far century, sad and slow,  
I have a vision, and I know  
The heathen shall return.  

They shall not come with warships,  
They shall not waste with brands,  
But books be all their eating,  
And ink be on their hands." — G.K. Chesterton, _The Ballad of the White Horse_

- "Aristocrats make schools in caves where hermits anticipate the Promised Land while still lost in the desert... the few who still care must teach in catacombs or tents... Christian radicals who subvert the secular order not by terrorism but sacrifice, who never lie, but don't say what they think until they must, who walk, as Saint Paul said, circumspectly, redeeming the time." — John Senior, _Restoration of Innocence_ (Radical counter-cultural schools)

- "Schools must provide good educators and fertile soil, not curricula." — John Senior, synthesis (Educators over systems)

- "These foster repose and sensory delight... Physical rigor, adventure, and stories." — John Senior, on Gymnasium Canon (Books as formation)

- "Stripped or lightly clad boys exercise, sharpening their five senses in immediate contact with nature." — John Senior (Gymnasium principle)

- "A boy will keep the course he has begun; even when he grows old, he will not leave it." — Proverbs 22:6 (Knox) (Early formation as determinative)

- "The beginning in every work is the chief thing, especially in the case of anything young and tender. For then especially is the character moulded." — Plato, _Republic_ II.376-377 (Early formation's decisive importance)

- "Give them ample liberty to jump, run, and make a din as much as they please. Gymnastics, music, declamation (of poems, etc), theatricals, and hikes, are very effective methods for getting discipline; they favor good living and good health." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Physical liberty as formative discipline)

- "Do whatever you wish; for me, it is enough you do not sin." — St. Philip Neri (quoted by St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_) (Freedom within virtue)

- "The students are always under the vigilant eye of the Director and the assistants, who like loving fathers will converse with them, act as guides in every event, counsel them and lovingly correct them." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Fatherly vigilance and guidance)

## IV. LITURGICAL RHYTHM AND REST (Enclosed Garden and Repose)

**Philosophical Grounding:**  
The enclosed garden (hortus conclusus) protects innocence through liturgical rhythm—daily prayer, sacraments, seasonal feasts—woven organically without rigid schedules. The soul, having poured itself outward through senses and adventure, must return to simplicity and repose. Rest restores; rhythm sustains. The family and Church, not the State, guard this sacred enclosure.

- "Education mirrors the 'ages of man' (nursery, gymnasium, poetic), integrated with daily prayer, sacraments, and seasonal feasts in a flexible, organic way." — John Senior, synthesis (Liturgical integration)

- "Paternal authority can be neither abolished nor absorbed by the State." — _Rerum Novarum_, Pope Leo XIII (Family sovereignty)

- "Blessed are the timid hearts that evil hate,  
that quail in its shadow, and yet shut the gate;

weave tissues gilded by the far-off day  
hoped and believed in under Shadow's sway." — J.R.R. Tolkien, _Mythopoeia_ (Protected enclosure amid threat)

- "As a tide turns on the tall grey seas, See how they waver in the trees... And the Mother of God goes over them, Walking on wind and flame, And we all shall yet drink Christian ale In the village of our name." — G.K. Chesterton, _The Ballad of the White Horse_, Book VII (Liturgical restoration)

- "Frequent Confession, frequent Communion, and daily Mass are the pillars that ought to support an educational edifice, from which one would want to keep at bay threats and violence." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Sacraments as educational pillars)

- "Religion or the rod." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Stark choice in education)

- "Every evening after the usual prayers, and before the students go to bed, the Director or someone in his place should offer a few kind words in public... This is the key to good behavior, progress, and educational success." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Daily rhythm of fatherly counsel)

## V. FOUNDATIONAL WISDOM (Catholic Fidelity and Distributist Justice)

**Philosophical Grounding:**  
This philosophy is Catholic—exclusionary in fidelity to core tenets, resistant to modern systematization. It affirms human dignity, property rights, and decentralized authority rooted in family and Church. Against mechanization and centralized power, it calls for distributist justice: restoring capital and authority to the many. Uncompromising truth spoken with charity.

### Quote Bank: Foundational Wisdom

- "This philosophy is inherently Catholic, exclusionary in its fidelity to core tenets, and resistant to modern systematization." — John Senior (Philosophical identity)

- "It is not they that have forgot the Night,  
or bid us flee to organized delight,  
in lotus-isles of economic bliss

(and counterfeit at that, machine-produced,  
bogus seduction of the twice-seduced)." — J.R.R. Tolkien, _Mythopoeia_ (Against organized mechanization)

- "The correct association for the negative attitude towards intuitive knowledge is the seventeenth century, starting with Descartes... This is the 'Enlightenment' or the 'Age of Reason'." — James S. Taylor, _Poetic Knowledge_ (Cartesian dualism as origin of fragmentation)

- "Dost thou doubt it? The very beasts will tell thee, the birds in air will be thy counsellors; the secret is known in every cranny of the earth, the fish in the sea will make it known to thee; none doubts, I tell thee, that all this is the Lord's doing." — Job 12:7-10 (Knox) (Creation speaks divine order)

- "I could not be then, O my God, could not be at all, wert Thou not in me; or, rather, unless I were in Thee, of whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things." — Augustine, _Confessions_ I.1 (Divine foundational reality)

Reason and Religion are the means the educator should constantly make use of, teaching them, making use of them himself, if he wishes to be obeyed and to attain his goal." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Christian pedagogy as essential)

- "An educator is one devoted to the well-being of his students, and for this reason, ought to be ready to face every inconvenience, and every fatigue to achieve his goal, which is the civil, moral, and intellectual education of his students." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Educator's total devotion)

- "The Preventive system makes a friend of the student, who in the teacher sees a benefactor who gives him good advice, wants to make him good, to shield him from unpleasantness, punishment, and dishonor." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Friendship over coercion)

- "One should use the greatest prudence and patience to have the student understand his fault through reason and religion." — St. Don Bosco, _The Preventative System_ (Correction through understanding)
