## What Is the Gymnasium Stage?

The gymnasium stage (ages 7-13) represents a critical period for physical discipline, adventure, and the unpoisoning of wonder. John Senior emphasized that modern education often fails boys at this age by neglecting bodily formation and experiential learning.

### Key Principles

1. **Physical Discipline & Adventure**
   - Outdoor challenges (hiking, camping, physical games)
   - Benevolent neglect allowing risk and resilience
   - Stories of heroes and warriors

2. **Liturgical Rhythm**
   - Family prayers tied to seasons
   - Saints' feast celebrations
   - Sacred reading at meals

3. **Poetic Knowledge**
   - Memorization of poetry and scripture
   - Exposure to beauty (nature, art, music)
   - Wonder before analysis

## Practical Suggestions (Non-Prescriptive)

### Daily Rhythms
- Morning prayer and scripture reading
- Physical activity (1-2 hours outdoors when possible)
