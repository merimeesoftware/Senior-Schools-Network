# Founder's Toolkit
## An Informal Checklist for Stage-Specific School Initiatives

**Version 0.1 - Phase 2 Placeholder**

---

### Important Notice

This document is a **placeholder** for the full Founder's Toolkit currently in development. The Senior Schools Network offers this resource as **informal guidance**, not a rigid blueprint. Each founding initiative requires discernment, prayer, and adaptation to local context. We are here to encourage, not prescribe.

---

## Vision & Calling

Before proceeding with practical steps, founders should discern:

- **Is there a genuine gymnasium gap in your area?** Consider demographics, existing schools, and cultural needs.
- **Are you called to this work?** Founding a school is a significant spiritual and practical commitment.
- **Do you have a community?** Networks of families, educators, and benefactors are essential.

### Scripture Waypoint

> "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you."  
> — Matthew 11:28 (DRV)

## Philosophical Foundations

### Core Principles to Embrace

1. **Poetic Knowledge**: Education begins with wonder, sensory integration, and connatural knowing (not premature abstraction).

2. **Stage-Specific Focus**: Each stage (nursery, gymnasium, poetic, spiritual) has unique needs. Consider focusing on one (e.g., gymnasium for boys ages 7-13).

3. **Physical Discipline & Adventure**: For gymnasium schools, prioritize outdoor challenges, bodily formation, and experiential learning.

4. **Non-Prescriptive Curriculum**: Avoid rigid schemas. Curricula should emerge organically from Catholic tradition, great books, and educator wisdom.

5. **Catholic Fidelity**: Grounded in liturgical rhythms, sacred scripture, and Church teaching.

1. **Premature abstraction**: Don't impose analytical frameworks before poetic foundations are laid.
2. **Mechanization**: Avoid rigid curricula, standardized testing, or industrial models.
3. **Isolation**: Connect with the network and other founders for support.
4. **Impatience**: Schools take time to develop organically. Trust the process.
5. **Lack of prayer**: Ground all planning in liturgical rhythms and spiritual discernment.
