# Book Suggestions by Developmental Stage

This reading list is organized by the natural stages of childhood and adolescent development. The goal is to nourish the imagination with great stories, beautiful language, and noble characters that prepare the soul for wisdom. These are books that have stood the test of time, creating a foundation of shared cultural experience and poetic knowledge.

When selecting editions, prioritize those with high-quality illustrations, especially for younger readers. The great illustrators of the 19th and early 20th centuries—Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, Walter Crane, Gustave Doré, Beatrix Potter, Arthur Rackham, Howard Pyle, and N.C. Wyeth—created works of art that enhance the imaginative experience of reading.

## Notes on Reading

This list represents a foundation—a starting point rather than an exhaustive catalog. Many authors have written numerous works of equal merit to those listed here. The goal is not to tick boxes but to cultivate a love of reading and a rich imaginative life.

**On Choosing Editions:** For younger readers especially, seek out editions with beautiful illustrations. The visual experience is part of the imaginative formation. Look for works by the great illustrators: Arthur Rackham, N.C. Wyeth, Howard Pyle, Beatrix Potter, Kate Greenaway, and others.

**On Reading Aloud:** The nursery and early school years are ideal for family read-alouds. Even older children benefit from hearing great literature read with expression and warmth. This creates shared cultural touchstones and memories.

**On Rereading:** The best books reveal new depths with each reading. Don't hesitate to return to childhood favorites as you mature—you'll discover layers you missed before.

**On Going Deeper:** This list emphasizes imaginative literature because the imagination must be fed before the intellect can properly function. After establishing this foundation, students are prepared for the great works of philosophy, theology, and science that build upon it.
