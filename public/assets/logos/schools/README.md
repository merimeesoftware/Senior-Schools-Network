# School Logos

This directory contains school crests and logos for the Senior Schools Network directory.

## How to Add a Logo

1. **Obtain the school's official logo or crest** from their website or contact them directly
2. **Place the file in this directory** with the filename matching the school ID:
   - Example: `st-dunstans-academy.png`, `gregory-the-great-academy.png`
3. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: PNG with transparent background (preferred), or SVG
   - Size: 200x200px minimum, 500x500px ideal
   - Color: Full color or single color (preferably matching school colors)
   - Style: Crest/emblem format works best for classical schools

## Current Placeholders

Each school currently has a placeholder SVG crest. These will be replaced as official logos are obtained:

- `st-dunstans-academy.svg` → St. Dunstan's Academy
- `st-josephs-academy.svg` → St. Joseph's Academy
- `gregory-the-great-academy.svg` → Gregory the Great Academy
- `la-salette-academy.svg` → La Salette Academy
- `saint-andrews-academy.svg` → Saint Andrew's Academy
- `st-martins-academy.svg` → St. Martin's Academy

## Notes

- Placeholders use a classical crest design with school initials
- Once official logos are added, the application will automatically use them
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP
- The system handles both raster and vector formats seamlessly
