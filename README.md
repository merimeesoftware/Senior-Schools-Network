# Senior Schools Network

## Overview

This repository serves as the foundational hub for the Senior Schools Network project, inspired by the educational philosophy of Dr. John Senior as articulated in _The Restoration of Innocence: An Idea of a School_ and related works. The project's north star is the promotion and loose affiliation of schools that embody poetic knowledge, sensory-based learning, narrative immersion, and natural exploration, integrated with moral and spiritual formation rooted in Catholic tradition. Drawing from Senior's emphasis on the "poetic mode" of apprehension—where knowledge begins with wonder, senses, and imagination, and rejects rigid schemas in favor of organic, experiential growth through good educators—this initiative focuses on identifying and highlighting existing schools that align with these principles, while encouraging new initiatives without imposition.

The objectives are:

1. **School Network Promotion**: Discover and promote schools already operating in this spirit (e.g., from an existing list of high schools and colleges), fostering a loose network for mutual support and visibility.
2. **Encouragement for Participation**: Provide avenues for schools to apply for affiliation, individuals to reach out, or aspiring founders to start aligned schools with informal guidance from the network—emphasizing flexibility and the role of dedicated educators over standardized curricula.
3. **Digital Platform**: Develop a website or application to showcase Senior's ideas, share resources (e.g., book lists, excerpts, media), and connect educators, parents, and stakeholders in a non-prescriptive manner.

All development in this repository must align with these goals, ensuring outputs reflect Senior's vision of education as soul formation through repose, wonder, and integrated humanities, without enforcing schemas that contradict the poetic, connatural approach.

## Foundational Influence: The Integrated Humanities Program (IHP)

The Senior Schools Network traces its spiritual lineage to the Integrated Humanities Program (IHP), founded by Dr. John Senior along with Dennis Quinn and Frank Nelick at the University of Kansas from 1967 to 1983. As the "grandfather" of this project, the IHP exemplified poetic knowledge through immersive experiences in great books, poetry recitation, music, stargazing, and communal activities like waltzing—designed to awaken wonder and pursue truth without rigid structures. This program, which led to profound conversions and lifelong transformations among students, emphasized the poetic mode as the fertile soil for wisdom, countering modern fragmentation by integrating senses, emotions, and intellect in a Catholic-inspired framework. The network honors this legacy by promoting similar educator-driven, wonder-based approaches in contemporary schools, adapting IHP's principles of repose and narrative immersion for stages like the gymnasium (physical adventure) while maintaining organic flexibility.

## Core Philosophy

The guiding light is Senior's framework from _The Restoration of Innocence_, synthesized with complementary texts such as excerpts from Hugh of St. Victor's _Didascalicon_, G.K. Chesterton's _The Outline of Sanity_, Tolkien's _Mythopoeia_, Boethius's _The Consolation of Philosophy_, papal encyclicals like _Rerum Novarum_, and Aquinas's _Summa Theologica_ (e.g., on intellectual knowledge). This philosophy is inherently Catholic, exclusionary in its fidelity to core tenets, and resistant to modern systematization.

### Key Concepts:

- **Poetic Knowledge**: As described in Taylor's excerpts (from _Poetic Knowledge: The Recovery of Education_), this is an intuitive, connatural mode of knowing through senses, emotions, and imagination—contrasting with rational or scientific modes. It begins with wonder (e.g., a child's encounter with nature) and progresses to wisdom. Senior's "five modes of knowledge" (gymnastic, musical, poetic, dialectic, rhetoric) and "eight modes of teaching" emphasize starting from sensory delight, as in Hugh of St. Victor's sensory ascent to wisdom, relying on good educators rather than imposed structures. From Tolkien's _Mythopoeia_: "Man, sub-creator, the refracted light through whom is splintered from a single White to many hues, and endlessly combined in living shapes that move from mind to mind."

- **Liturgical Rhythm and Spiritual Formation**: Education mirrors the "ages of man" (nursery, gymnasium, poetic, etc.), integrated with daily prayer, sacraments, and seasonal feasts in a flexible, organic way. Senior's "hortus conclusus" (enclosed garden) evokes a protected space for innocence, drawing from _Rerum Novarum_'s emphasis on justice, property, and family. Liturgical hikes and narrative adventures foster repose and virtue, countering modern mechanization (per Chesterton), without rigid curricula. From Boethius's _The Consolation of Philosophy_: "Earth we grasp with the earthly, fire with flame, Liquid with moisture, air with our breath."

- **Physical Discipline and Adventure**: Particularly in the gymnasium stage (ages 7-13), education incorporates bodily rigor and experiential challenges—harsh at times—to form resilient individuals, especially boys into "Chivalric Wayfarers." This blends sports, outdoor adventures, and risk-taking with stories, learning, and liturgical rhythms with stories, addressing contemporary issues like sedentary lifestyles and the erosion of physical resilience in modern youth. It counters cultural softness by emphasizing benevolent neglect and natural toughness with play and story. From Chesterton's _The Ballad of the White Horse_: "For the end of the world was long ago, And all we dwell to-day As children of some second birth, Like a strange people left on earth After a judgment day."

- **Poetic Foundations for Scientific Pursuit**: Poetic knowledge serves as the fertile soil for scientific inquiry, nurturing imagination and wonder as prerequisites for disciplined reasoning. Modern education often misorders this, prioritizing analysis over wonder—IHP countered this through stargazing and poetry as gateways to truth. From Aquinas's _Summa Theologica_ (Question 84, Article 1): "The soul knows bodies through the intellect."

### User-Centric Design and Marketing (StoryBrand Three-Path System)

The platform and all promotional efforts follow the StoryBrand methodology to engage users effectively. Visitors (parents, educators, aspiring founders) are positioned as the "hero" seeking restoration of innocence in education, facing problems like cultural decay and loss of wonder. Senior's philosophy and the network serve as the empathetic "guide," providing a clear plan for exploration, affiliation, and inspiration. User flows and stories ensure intuitive, narrative-driven experiences, emphasizing the gymnasium stage (ages 7-13) as a critical yet underserved phase, while noting nursery strengths and kindergarten opportunities:

- **Primary User Story/Flow (Discovery to School Consideration/Affiliation)**: As a parent of boys (hero), I face the gap in gymnasium-stage education—lacking adventure and formation amid cultural softness (problem). I discover Senior's ideas as a guide, explore existing high schools (plan: explore resources → view schools → inquire/apply), avoid failure (continued mechanized schooling), and achieve success (resilient, faith-formed sons prepared as Chivalric Wayfarers). _Flow_: Home (quote from _Mythopoeia_: "We make still by the law in which we're made.") → Schools Directory (filter by high school boarding) → CTA: "Inquire About Enrollment" or "Apply to Affiliate." Waypoint: "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord." (Ephesians 6:4).

- **Secondary User Story/Flow (Resource Exploration to Personal/Family Application)**: As a homeschooling parent or engaged family (hero), I excel in nursery but seek gymnasium inspiration amid lacking options (problem). Senior's resources guide me to adapt ideas at home, take action (family adventures, e.g., liturgical hikes), and succeed in unpoisoning the soil for my children's formation—potentially inspiring kindergarten restoration. _Flow_: Home/Resources (quote from _The Restoration of Innocence_: "Poetic knowledge is the key to motivation because it is about what is REAL... Connection and wonder are the driving forces. Love is the anchor.") → Browse excerpts/book lists (e.g., Robin Hood) → CTA: "Download Gymnasium Guide" (non-prescriptive PDF). Waypoint: "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." (Proverbs 22:6).

- **Tertiary User Story/Flow (Inspiration to Founding)**: As an aspiring founder/educator (hero), I recognize the gymnasium gap—sorely lacking amid strong nursery homeschooling and high schools (problem). Senior's resources guide me to informal resources, take action (connect/network), avoid isolation (failure), and succeed in founding a stage-specific initiative (e.g., gymnasium for boys). _Flow_: Home ("Start a School: Restore gymnasium for Chivalric Wayfarers") → Encouragement page (blog, media embeds) → CTA: "Reach Out for Guidance" or "Founder's Toolkit." Waypoint: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28).

- **Integration Across Phases**: All development phases derive user flows from this framework, interweaving quotes/Scripture as waypoints to evoke wonder, ensuring marketing resonates with themes of adventure, discipline, and fertile soil for diverse pursuits, with a special call to restore the gymnasium stage while noting kindergarten opportunities.

## Guardrails and Principles

- **Alignment**: All contributions must reference uploaded documents for authenticity; promote balanced, non-partisan viewpoints. Avoid imposing curricula—focus on promotion and loose connections.
- **Ethical Focus**: Emphasize charity, humility; avoid moralizing—treat users as adults pursuing truth.
- **Derivation Chain**: Technical details derive from `technical.md`; AI instructions from `instructions.md`; phases from `current-phase.md`; prompts from phases.
- **Iteration**: Use phases for builds; commit changes with references to philosophy.

This north star ensures the project remains faithful to Senior's vision, fostering a renaissance in education through poetic, faith-integrated means without rigid enforcement.
