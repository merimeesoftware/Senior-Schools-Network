# Senior Schools Network

## Overview
This repository serves as the foundational hub for the Senior Schools Network project, inspired by the educational philosophy of Dr. John Senior as articulated in *The Restoration of Innocence: An Idea of a School* and related works. The project's north star is the promotion and loose affiliation of schools that embody poetic knowledge, sensory-based learning, narrative immersion, and natural exploration, integrated with moral and spiritual formation rooted in Catholic tradition. Drawing from Senior's emphasis on the "poetic mode" of apprehension—where knowledge begins with wonder, senses, and imagination, and rejects rigid schemas in favor of organic, experiential growth through good educators—this initiative focuses on identifying and highlighting existing schools that align with these principles, while encouraging new initiatives without imposition.

The objectives are:
1. **School Network Promotion**: Discover and promote schools already operating in this spirit (e.g., from an existing list of high schools and colleges), fostering a loose network for mutual support and visibility.
2. **Encouragement for Participation**: Provide avenues for schools to apply for affiliation, individuals to reach out, or aspiring founders to start aligned schools with informal guidance from the network—emphasizing flexibility and the role of dedicated educators over standardized curricula.
3. **Digital Platform**: Develop a website or application to showcase Senior's ideas, share resources (e.g., book lists, excerpts, media), and connect educators, parents, and stakeholders in a non-prescriptive manner.

All development in this repository must align with these goals, ensuring outputs reflect Senior's vision of education as soul formation through repose, wonder, and integrated humanities, without enforcing schemas that contradict the poetic, connatural approach.

## Core Philosophy
The guiding light is Senior's framework from *The Restoration of Innocence*, synthesized with complementary texts such as excerpts from Hugh of St. Victor's *Didascalicon*, G.K. Chesterton's *The Outline of Sanity*, Tolkien's *Mythopoeia*, Boethius's *The Consolation of Philosophy*, papal encyclicals like *Rerum Novarum*, and Aquinas's *Summa Theologica* (e.g., on intellectual knowledge). This philosophy is inherently Catholic, exclusionary in its fidelity to core tenets, and resistant to modern systematization.

### Key Concepts:
- **Poetic Knowledge**: As described in Taylor's excerpts (from *Poetic Knowledge: The Recovery of Education*), this is an intuitive, connatural mode of knowing through senses, emotions, and imagination—contrasting with rational or scientific modes. It begins with wonder (e.g., a child's encounter with nature) and progresses to wisdom. Senior's "five modes of knowledge" (gymnastic, musical, poetic, dialectic, rhetoric) and "eight modes of teaching" emphasize starting from sensory delight, as in Hugh of St. Victor's sensory ascent to wisdom, relying on good educators rather than imposed structures.

- **Liturgical Rhythm and Spiritual Formation**: Education mirrors the "ages of man" (nursery, gymnasium, poetic, etc.), integrated with daily prayer, sacraments, and seasonal feasts in a flexible, organic way. Senior's "hortus conclusus" (enclosed garden) evokes a protected space for innocence, drawing from *Rerum Novarum*'s emphasis on justice, property, and family. Liturgical hikes and narrative adventures foster repose and virtue, countering modern mechanization (per Chesterton), without rigid curricula.

- **Stages of Development**: 
  | Stage | Age Range | Focus | Examples from Resources |
  |-------|-----------|-------|-------------------------|
  | Nursery | 0-7 | Sensory delight, fables | Mother Goose, Peter Rabbit, Aesop (from Thousand Good Books List) |
  | Gymnasium | 7-13 | Adventure, stories | Robin Hood, Treasure Island; experiential learning through nature |
  | Poetic/Youth | 13-20 | Imagination, classics | Shakespeare, Tolstoy; integration of arts and sciences |
  | Spiritual (All Ages) | Lifelong | Devout life | Bible (Douay-Rheims), Pilgrim's Progress; music and art as per Senior |

- **Restoration of Innocence**: Combat cultural decay through nature, stories, and faith. Tolkien's *Mythopoeia* inspires sub-creation and wonder; Boethius's consolation through philosophy; Chesterton's distributism for small-scale, humane structures. Reject schemas; trust in educators to adapt organically.

This philosophy rejects modern metrics for soul-centric formation, treating students as "amateurs" who love and enjoy learning (per Senior), with the network serving as a loose, supportive framework.

## Network Goals
- **Loose Affiliation**: Promote existing schools (primarily high schools and colleges) that align with these ideas.
- **Discovery and Promotion**: Highlight schools from the provided list, showcasing their organic implementations to the world.
- **Participation Encouragement**: Include application forms for schools to join the network; resources for individuals to reach out, start aligned schools, or seek informal help—fostering growth through inspiration, not prescription.
- **Catholic Exclusivity**: The network is Catholic to its core, maintaining exclusionary fidelity to ensure coherence and effectiveness.
- **Expansion**: While the user aims to found a school for gymnastic ages (7-13 boys) locally, this repository and platform focus solely on the network, not the prototype school.

## Digital Platform
- **Purpose**: Serve as a promotional tool—biography of Senior, resource library (e.g., Thousand Good Books in tables), media embeds (videos/podcasts from excerpts.md), school directory/map.
- **Features**: Interactive book lists; excerpt viewers; application form for network affiliation; encouragement sections for starting schools (e.g., guides on finding educators, without schemas); blog for analyses.
- **Development Principles**: Simple, elegant design evoking classical order; prioritize accessibility and narrative flow. No content related to the user's local prototype school.

## Guardrails and Principles
- **Alignment**: All contributions must reference uploaded documents for authenticity; promote balanced, non-partisan viewpoints. Avoid imposing curricula—focus on promotion and loose connections.
- **Ethical Focus**: Emphasize charity, humility; avoid moralizing—treat users as adults pursuing truth.
- **Derivation Chain**: Technical details derive from `technical.md`; AI instructions from `instructions.md`; phases from `current-phase.md`; prompts from phases.
- **Iteration**: Use phases for builds; commit changes with references to philosophy.

This north star ensures the project remains faithful to Senior's vision, fostering a renaissance in education through poetic, faith-integrated means without rigid enforcement.
