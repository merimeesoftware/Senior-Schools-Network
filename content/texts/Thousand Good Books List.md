# The Thousand Good Books\ by John Senior

The \Great Books\ movement of the last generation has not failed so much as fizzled, not because of any defect in the books\the best that has been thought and said,\ in Matthew Arnold's phrasebut like good champagne in plastic bottles they went flat. To change the figure, the seeds are good but the cultural soil has been depleted; the seminal ideas of Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, St. Thomas, only properly grow in an imaginative ground saturated with fables, fairy tales, stories, rhymes, adventures, which have developed into the thousand books of Grimm, Andersen, Stevenson, Dickens, Scott, Dumas and the rest. Western tradition, taking all that was best of the Greco-Roman world into herself has given us the thousand good books as a preparation for the great ones and for all the studies in the arts and sciences, without which such studies are inhumane. The brutal athlete and the foppish aesthete suffer vices opposed to the virtue of what Newman called \the gentleman.\

It is commonly agreed also that both \great\ and \good\ can only be judged from a certain distance. Contemporary works can be appreciated and enjoyed but not very properly judged, and just as a principle must stand outside what follows from it (as a point to a line), so a cultural standard must be established from some time at least as distant as our grandparents'. For us today the cut-off point is World War I before which cars and the electric light had not yet come to dominate our lives and the experience of nature had not been distorted by speed and the destruction of shadows. There is a serious questionwith arguments on both sides surelyas to whether there can be any culture at all in a mechanized society. Whichever side one takes in that dispute, it is certainly true that we cannot understand the point at issue without an imaginative grasp of the world we have lost.

What follows is not a complete list: almost all the authors have written many books, some as good as the ones given; and there are undoubtedly authors of some importance inadvertently left outbut this is a sufficient work-sheet. Everyone will find more than enough that he hasn't read; and everything on this list is by common consent part of the ordinary cultural matter essential for an English-speaking person to grow in.

Remember that the point of view throughout a course of studies such as this is that of the amateurthe ordinary person who loves and enjoys what he lovesnot of the expert in critical, historical or textual technology.

The books have been divided (sometimes dubiously because some stand midway between the categories) into the stages of life corresponding to the classical \ages\ of man and in general agreement with the divisions of modern child psychology as explained by Freud or Piaget. And because sight is the first of the senses and especially powerful in early years, it is very important to secure books illustrated by artists working in the cultural tradition we are studying both as an introduction to art and as part of the imaginative experience of the book. This is not to disparage contemporary artists any more than the tradition itself disparages contemporary experimentquite the contrary, one of the fruits of such a course should be the encouragement of good writing and drawing. A standard must never be taken as a restrictive straitjacket but rather as a teacher and model for achievement. Book illustration reached its perfection in the nineteenth century in the work of Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, Walter Crane, Gustave Dore, George Cruikshank, \Phiz\, Gordon Browne, Beatrix Potter, Sir John Tenniel, Arthur Rackham, Howard Pyle, N.C. Wyeth, and many others.

The rule of thumb is to find a nineteenth-century edition or one of the facsimiles which (though not as sharp in the printing) are currently available at moderate prices. What follows is an incomplete work-sheet of unedited notes which may serve as a rough guide.

### SPIRITUAL READING (All ages)

Both are literary masterpieces as none other even remotely is. Since spiritual mysteries can only be communicated through poetry, whatever more modern versions may gain in accuracy is nothing compared to what is lost.
- Bunyan, John. Pilgrims Progressthe Great Protestant Masterpiece.
- de Sales, St Francis. Introduction to the Devout Lifethe best there is.

## MUSIC

Avoiding extremes of difficult and lightneither Bach nor Debussythe distinction between \great\ and good is blurred. The student should listen to one work only for at least a week, going over and over the separate movements or acts until the repeated themes are recognized as they recur. It is better to know a very few works very well than to run over vast amounts. The following is a good order for neophytes:

- Beethoven. Violin Concerto.
- Beethoven. Pastoral Symphony.
- Verdi. Rigoletto.

With an opera, read the entire libretto in English, then take only a single scene and play it through several times trying to follow the words in Italian (or French or German) with an understanding of their meaning. Having gone through the whole opera scene by scene, pick out great moments arias, duets, etc. It is good to have two recordings, one of the complete work, another of the highlights.

- Puccini. La Boheme
- Mozart. Clarinet Concerto or Oboe Concerto; Jupiter Symphony; Piano music (especially as played by Gieserking)
- Beethoven. Seventh Symphony.
- Brahms. Fourth Symphony.
- Chopin. Selections.

(Most important: Students should attend live concerts).

## ART

- The Kenneth Clark series Civilisation. Clark published a book with illustrations and the text of the series. And most important, visits to museums and galleries.
